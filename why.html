      <h2>Why Universal Design Matters</h2>
      <p>
        The web has always leveled up when regular people demanded better: CSS
        Zen Garden for design, web standards for clean code, HTML5 for real
        content structure. Universal design is the next push.

      <h3>1. Real people, real barriers</h3>
      <p>
        For some users, a missing label, low contrast, or keyboard-only trap
        isn’t just “annoying,” it’s a hard stop. If someone can’t check a form,
        read your content, or operate your menu, they’re basically locked out.
      </p>

      <h3>2. Good UX for everyone</h3>
      <p>
        Universal design doesn’t just help disabled users. It also helps:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>People on cracked screens or old devices.</li>
        <li>Students scrolling websites in loud spaces with audio off.</li>
        <li>People with ADHD, anxiety, or visual processing differences.</li>
        <li>Anyone who just wants a site that “makes sense” quickly.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>3. Future-proofing the web</h3>
      <p>
        Our generation is shipping the sites that will become somebody else’s
        legacy code. Basing that work on universal design means the web keeps
        moving toward being more open, not less.
      </p>

      <h3>4. Ethics, laws, and reputation</h3>
      <p>
        Accessibility lawsuits are rising, and guidelines like WCAG set clear
        expectations, but this is also about what kind of web we want to build.
        A site that welcomes more people is simply a better reflection of the
        world we live in.
