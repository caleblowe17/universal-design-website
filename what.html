      <h2>What is Universal Design?</h2>
      <p>
        Universal design is about creating digital experiences that work for
        as many people as possible from day one, instead of “fixing” them later.

      <h3>Core idea</h3>
      <p>
        Instead of designing for some “average user,” universal design accepts
        that real users have different bodies, devices, speeds, attention spans,
        and access needs. A universally designed site stays usable across all
        of that.

      <h3>Key principles (translated for devs)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Perceivable:</strong> Content can be seen or heard in more than one way.</li>
        <li><strong>Operable:</strong> People can use it with a mouse, keyboard, or assistive tech.</li>
        <li><strong>Understandable:</strong> Clear language, predictable navigation, and helpful feedback.</li>
        <li><strong>Robust:</strong> Works across browsers, devices, and assistive technologies.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Everyday examples</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Captions on videos (not just for Deaf users, but also for muted phones).</li>
        <li>Readable text and good contrast (better for everyone in bright light).</li>
        <li>Logical heading structure (helps both screen readers and scanning with your eyes).</li>
        <li>Buttons with real labels instead of mysterious icons.</li>
      </ul>
